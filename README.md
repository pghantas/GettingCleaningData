#Getting and Cleaning data README

There is only one script for this analysis that is  run_analysis.R. 
The code assumes that Samsung data is in the working directory and uses the package *PLYR*
CodeBook.md describes each of the variables used in run_analysis.R, 
the purpose of each transformation and the end result.
